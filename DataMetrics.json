// DataMetrics.json, which contains the features/qualities of the system. 
// The file is created to categorize and group the user stories and analyze the dependencies and constraints 
// they pose to the architectural design of the derived system. 
// In particular, the user stories are grouped based on their real-world scope, i.e., 
// user stories that have the same context and a similar scope are in the same group. 
// Further, the creation of a group is based on the following factors: 
// (a) user stories related to the same real-world object or situation are grouped together, and 
// (b) user stories of different users who perform the same action are grouped together. 
// From an architectural design point of view, all the user stories that belong to the 
// same group have to be fulfilled by the same container. In this way, the system ensures 
// the separation of concerns between containers while maintaining scope-related user 
// stories grouping. How the user stories are fulfilled by the microservices inside the container
//  is a design choice not inspected by this file.
